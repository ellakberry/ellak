PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
blas: blas (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)
blas: 
blas: The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide
blas: standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix 
blas: operations.  The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector, and vector-vector
blas: operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the 
blas: Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are 
blas: efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in 
blas: the development of high quality linear algebra software.
blas: Note: This package contains the reference *unoptimized* BLAS library.

PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
lapack: LAPACK (linear algebra routines)
lapack:
lapack: LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear
lapack: equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations,
lapack: eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. The associated matrix
lapack: factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are
lapack: also provided, as are related computations such as reordering of the
lapack: Schur factorizations and estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded
lapack: matrices are handled, but not general sparse matrices. In all areas,
lapack: similar functionality is provided for real and complex matrices, in
lapack: both single and double precision.

PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
octave: GNU Octave (Matlab clone)
octave:
octave: GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
octave: computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
octave: solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing
octave: other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible
octave: with Matlab.  It may also be used as a batch-oriented language.
