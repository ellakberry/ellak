blas: blas (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)
blas: 
blas: The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide
blas: standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix 
blas: operations.  The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector, and vector-vector
blas: operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the 
blas: Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are 
blas: efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in 
blas: the development of high quality linear algebra software.
blas: Note: This package contains the reference *unoptimized* BLAS library.
